# The Pragmatic Bookshelf has offices in Texas (TX) and North Carolina (NC),
# so we have to charge sales tax on orders shipped to these states.
# The rates can be expressed as a keyword list (I wish it were that simple....):
#
# tax_rates = [ NC: 0.075, TX: 0.08 ]
#
# Write a function that takes both lists and returns a copy of the orders,
# but with an extra field, total_amount, which is the net plus sales tax.
# If a shipment is not to NC or TX, thereâ€™s no tax applied.

tax_rates = [ NC: 0.075, TX: 0.08 ]
