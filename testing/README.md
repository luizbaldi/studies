Repo created to store my studies and courses related to TDD in Javascript!

## Courses

So far, the courses I'm doing are:

- [Testing JavaScript](https://testingjavascript.com/)
- [Aprenda Testes Unitarios com Javascript](https://www.udemy.com/aprenda-testes-unitarios-com-jasmine-javascript)
- [JS com tdd na pr√°tica](https://www.udemy.com/js-com-tdd-na-pratica)
- [The Coding Interview Bootcamp: Algorithms + Data Structure](https://www.udemy.com/coding-interview-bootcamp-algorithms-and-data-structure)

The folders are separated by course, so things keep organized.

And that's all :)
