# C++ studies

After this years working full time with JavaScript mostly on frontend but also on backend and digging more into the architecture behind technologies I've basically got _tired_ of hitting a point where I ended up feeling like _"oh well so this is done using C++, here we go again"_, so I've decided to go back study more about it.

This repository is just a simple place to store my studies so I can see my progress and use it like some sort of lab, simple as that.
