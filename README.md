# Studies

Just sharing my studies, following the idea of learning in public :)

At some point, I realized that I had many repositories for studying purposes, so I created this one to centralize them all _(or rule them all, if you prefer)_.

All folders are named according to the technology being studied.

> [!NOTE]
> The code in the repository is meant to serve as a place to find snippets and references, so I don't recommend running a project and installing dependencies because there's a considerable chance that they have security vulnerabilities.
